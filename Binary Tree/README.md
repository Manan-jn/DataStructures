# Binary Tree
## Leetcode
### Easy 
- [938. Range Sum of BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-of-bst/)
```
Approach -1: Simple BST traversal of the binary tree and if we get the value between high and low will add to the
              sum and return sum
Approach -2: BFS traversal of the tree level by level and if we get the value between high and low will add to the
              sum and return sum
```
- [617. Merge Two Binary Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-binary-trees/)
```
Approach: Traverse both the trees from root to bottom and when both of them are not NULL then add their values and
            if the root2 is NULL then return it

```
- [897. Increasing Order Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-order-search-tree/)
```
Approach: Store the inorder traversal of the tree in the vector and build the seperate tree from that vector and return it
