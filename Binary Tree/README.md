## Leetcode
### Easy 
- [938. Range Sum of BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-of-bst/)
```
Approach -1: Simple BST traversal of the binary tree and if we get the value between high and low will add to 
              the sum and return sum
Approach -2: BFS traversal of the tree level by level and if we get the value between high and low will add to
              the sum and return sum
